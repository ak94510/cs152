1. subs creates two paths to build off of at each recursion. Then each of those paths branch off to more possible
combinations of characters.It terminates because the index is incremented with each call until it equals the length.
It gives the right answer because it covers all possible combinations of of the characters.
2.lcs comapres each letter of a to each letter of b. If they match, then it count how many concecutive letters match
after the match. The longest string of concecutive matches is the lcs. It terminates because it reaches the end of
a string. It gives the right answer because it tests all comparisons of a and b
3.onebits takes a number and recusivly devides it by 2. Any time it has a remainder of 1, it adds the counter to
the list and then incremtents the counter. The recursion converges because any number continuously divided by 2 will
reach 1 and a Integer 1 divided by 2 equels zero which closes the recursion. This works because the counter keeps
track of the positions of the 1's in the binary equivilent.
