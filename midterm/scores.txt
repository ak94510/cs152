Problem 1

Defines recursive helper (max. 2): 0
Calls recursive helper (max. 2):
Base case (max. 2):
Even length (max. 2):
Odd length (max. 2):

No recursive helper

Problem 2

Fold call (max. 3): 3
Fold function even case (max. 2): 2
Fold function odd case (max. 2): 2
Fold diagram (max. 3): 0

Problem 3

Flatmap, then map (max. 3):5
Combines elements correctly (max. 2): 

Problem 4

Parses ^ (max. 2):2
Evaluates ^ (max. 2):2
Correct precedence (max. 3):3
Right associative (max. 3): 0

Problem 5

. binds stronger than ::  (max. 2): 2
. parsed as MethodCall (max. 2):2
Chained . supported  (max. 2): 0
MethodCall evaluated in correct location (max. 2): 2
MethodCall evaluated as instructed  (max. 2): 1

You need to cast since you don't know that result is a list
