    <h3>Exam Problems</h3> 
    <ol>
      <li>(10 points) 
        <p>A permutation cycle indicates how a permutation rearranges elements in a single orbit. For example, (2 4 1 3) maps 2 to 4, 4 to 1, 1 to 3, and 3 again to 2. A cycle is <em>normalized</em> if it starts with the smallest element. The normalized form of (2 4 1 3) is (1 3 2 4).</p> 
        <p>Any permutation can be written as a list of cycles. The cycle list is normalized if each cycle is normalized, and the cycles are sorted by their first element. For example, the normalized form of (2 4 1 3)(9 7 6)(5 8) is (1 3 2 4)(5 8)(6 9 7).</p> 
        <p>To normalize a cycle, you must shift it so that its minimum comes first. Implement a general function <code>shift</code> that takes a list and an element, and returns the shifted list that starts with the given element. For example, <code>(shift '(2 4 1 3) 1)</code> should yield the list <code>(1 3 2 4)</code>. You may assume that the element exists in the list exactly once.</p>
        <p>Then we can implement a Racket function <code>normalizeCycle</code> that takes a cycle, as a list of length ≥ 2, and produces the normalized version: </p>
        <pre>(define (normalizeCycle cycle) (shift cycle (first (sort cycle &lt;))))</pre>
        <p>Now implement a Racket function <code>normalize</code> that normalizes a list of cycles. You must use <code>map</code> in your solution. No recursion. For sorting the normalized cycles, use <code>(sort cycles lessThan)</code>, where <code>lessThan</code> is an appropriate comparison function or lambda expression.</p> 
        <p>Note: In Racket's map function, the function argument comes before the list.</p> 
        <pre>(map (lambda (number) (+ 1 number)) (1 2 3 4))</pre> 
        <p>Complete the file <code>problem1.rkt</code>.</p> 
      </li> 
      <li>(10 points) Repeat the preceding assignment in Prolog. You may choose any implementation strategy, and use any library functions. Complete the file <code>problem2.prolog</code>.</li> 
      <li>(10 points) In this assignment, we consider mutual recursion in SL1.
        <ul><li>Consider this example:
            <pre>def even = { x =&gt; if (x - 1) odd(x - 1) else if (x) 0 else 1 };
def odd = { x =&gt; if (x - 1) even(x - 1) else if (x) 1 else 0 };
even(42)</pre>
            Why doesn't this work? Don't just say “because SL1 throws an exception.” What is the underlying reason?
          </li>
          <li>This can be fixed by making one of the functions local to the other:
            <pre>def even = { x =&gt; 
  def odd =  { x =&gt; if (x - 1) even(x - 1) else if (x) 1 else 0 };
  if (x - 1) odd(x - 1) else if (x) 0 else 1
};
even(42)
</pre> When this program is parsed, what objects does the parser return for <code>even</code> and <code>odd</code>?</li>
          <li>What objects are produced when these objects from the parse tree are evaluated? Describe the symbol tables exactly.</li>
          <li>Why does this version work when the first version didn't?</li>
          <li>Can you define <code>even</code> with a <code>val</code> instead of a <code>def</code>? Can you define <code>odd</code> with a <code>val</code> instead of a <code>def</code>? Why or why not?</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>Put in your description in plain text (Mac TextEdit users—not RTF!) into <code>problem3.txt</code>. Feel free to hand in paper with sketches of the data structures.</p> 
      </li> 
      <li>(10 points) In the <code>problem4</code> project, implement a Scala class <code>MultiMap[K,V]</code> that maps keys of type <code>K</code> to values of type <code>V</code>. A key can be associated with more than one value. Simply use a list of pairs, like we did with the symbol tables in SL1. Provide methods 
        <pre>get(k)
put(k, v)
</pre> The <code>get</code> method yields a <code>List</code> with the values for the given key, which may be empty if there is none. The <code>put</code> method yields a new table of the appropriate type that contains the new entry and the entries of the current table. Provide the appropriate variances for the types <code>K</code> and <code>V</code>, and do whatever else you need to do so that the test cases in <code>MultiMapSuite</code> pass.
      </li> 
      <li>(15 points) In the <code>sl3</code> project, enhance SL3 so that it can handle <code>^</code> as a “raise to a power” operator. Raising to a power  binds more strongly than multiplication/division and is right-associative. For example, 4^2^3 = 4^(2^3) = 65536. <br/> Generate code equivalent to the following: 
            <pre>(int)java.lang.Math.pow((double) x, (double) y) 
</pre> Use the (non-static) method <code>InstructionList.createCast(Type src_type, Type dest_type)</code> to create the casts.
      <br/>     
      Here is a test program for your convenience.
        <pre>main() {
   print(3 * 2 ^ 4 - 6);
   print(4 ^ 2 ^ 3);
   return 0;
}
</pre>
        <p>You will get partial credit for implementing the parser even if you can't generate code.</p>
